# Social-Network-API

## Description

Social networks apps allow users to be friends, post thoughts, and react to other users' thoughts. This experience may feel seamless on the user side but behing the scenes it can be difficult to keep all of the information organized. To solve this chalenge, I have utilized the MongoDB NoSQL database. This implimentation keeps all of the information created and linked by the above method organized, easy to read, and readily available. If you need a backend engine to support your social media app, an implimentation such as this one can help your app data to be sustainable and scalable for future growth.

When making this app I learned the importance of NoSQL databases, MongoDB, and the mongoose npm package to create a database and routing suitable for social media interactivity.

## Installation

To use this app, follow these steps (You will need MongoDB, Node, and an API client such as Insomnia on your machine as well):

- From the repo root, run the following command: `npm run start`

## Usage

When the app is launched, head over to Insomnia or another API client. From the you can test a variety of User routes and Thought routes.
